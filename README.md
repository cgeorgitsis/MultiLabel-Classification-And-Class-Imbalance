# Multi-label Classification and Class Imbalance
A project created for the course Advanced Topics in Machine Learning.
We tackled the problems of multi-label classification and class imbalance.

## Multi-label Classification
For this task we decided to work with a movie dataset from the IMDB. The dataset can be obtained from this [link from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv). 
You only need the movies_metadata.csv file. Please move the file inside the **dataset** folder.
